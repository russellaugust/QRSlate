I worked on this project for a year and loved it.  It came in really handy on some shoots, but I've been too busy to do all of the upkeep and programming on my own.  I've also come to appreciate the open source community more and believe it's important to be involved in it. 


**QRSlate**

*A Digital Movie Slate Importer*

QRSlate bridges the gap between production and editorial.

Using the slate as a barcoding system, QR Slate sends important information (scene, take, camera rolls, a scene description, etc) directly to the camera for integration into Avid Media Composer, Final Cut Pro 7, Final Cut X and Premiere metadata.

THE PROCESS 

Shoot your project using QR Slate the same way you'd shoot with any other slate: Hold it up and record it. Make sure the camera can see it!

When you're finished, import the footage to your computer like usual. Drag and drop the movie files into the QR Slate desktop application. The Desktop App will analyze your video, find the slates within the movies themselves, and then import the footage into Final Cut Pro 7 and Avid with the included metadata!

But what if you've already slated the take, you're rolling, and need to revise it? Or there's a take you really like and want to mark it for later? You couldn't have known that before the roll!

The Script Supervisor / Take Organizer lets you revise, modify, and delete takes on set. You can change any available field and get everything clean and organized before passing it off to editorial. All those preciously helpful script supervisor notes will no longer by thrown in a drawer next to the sound report ever again!

During the roll, you can also drop Markers. Markers can be named and commented on, and will appear in your clip when imported into the NLE, right where you added them during the shoot! A powerful tool for long single takes on things like reality tv or documentary.

When you're ' shoot, you can email yourself an updater file, drop it in with the footage, and your media will be automatically updated with the most recent metadata!

*Note:  This is the code for the desktop importer.*
